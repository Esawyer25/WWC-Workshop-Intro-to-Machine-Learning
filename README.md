# Women Who Code Workshop: Intro to Machine Learning in Python

## Preparation for the Workshop
We will be using Python and Jupyter Notebook to navigate through our code. The installation process is much easier for mac users, but we'll do our best to get you up and running on a PC. If you aren't able to follow the instructions below you can follow along with the Lecture Notes on github and trouble-shoot later.

### Download and Install Anaconda
Anaconda is a an open source package management software that allows you to easily install many of the Python libraries we will be using (and more!!).
You can download Anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
We'll be using version 2.7, but you are welcome to download later versions. There will be some syntactical differences but they are more or less the same.

### Setup a Github account (optional)
The workshop notes and datasets we'll be working with are all on Github. You don't need an account to view the notes or download the whole repo to your local drive.  However there are many benefits to using GitHub (including version control), so if you want to make changes to the code and save a version of it online, you will need your own account. Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/join?source=header-repo

### Fork the Lecture Notes Repository (optional)
If you plan to push changes to GitHub you'll need your own forked version! In the upper right hand corner of this repo, click "Fork." Again, if you've never done this GitHub has solid documentation to help walk you through forking: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

### Clone this repo to your local drive
If you've already forked the repo you can skip this step. If you chose not to create your own github account, you can clone the repo directly to your local drive and work with the files that way. On the right-side of your screen click the green button that says "clone or download." Follow along with these instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

### Launch a Jupyter Notebook
In your terminal window, navigate to your cloned repo and type 'Jupyter Notebook' into the command line. It should launch a new browser window. If it doesn't copy and paste the localhost url into a new browser window.

## Introduction
In this hands-on workshop, we will be creating a fun communication app named Positivity Dose. Positivity Dose allows you to select a contact from your phone’s contact list and send him/her a motivational SMS message. This app also displays when and to whom the last message or ‘positivity dose’ was sent. Through this workshop, we will build & refactor this app one step at a time, implementing the concepts and topics we introduce.

For the next steps, please attend the workshop at Women Who Code.
Happy Coding!

Checklist
At the beginning of the workshop you should have:
- Anaconda installed
- GitHub Account created (optional)
- Local version of the repository cloned
- Jupyter Notebook launched, pointing to your version of the repo
